# US009 - Register a vaccination center to respond to a certain pandemic

## 1. Requirements Engineering

In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to register a vaccination center to respond to a certain pandemic.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 
**From the Specifications Document**

"The DGS vaccination process is mainly carried out through community mass vaccination centers and health care centers across the country."

"Different from the health care centers, which provide a wide range of healthcare services to citizens to a certain area, the community mass vacccination centers are facilities specifically created to administer vaccines of a single type as response to an ongoing disease outbreak."

"The main difference between the two kinds of centers is that health care center is associated with a given ARS and AGES, and it can administer any type of vaccines"

"Both kinds of vaccination centers are characterized by a name, and address, a phone number, an e-mail addres, a fax number, a website address, opening and closing hours, slot duratiion (e.g.: 5 minutes) and the maximum number of vaccines that can be given per slot (e.g.: 10 vaccines per slot).). In addition,
each vaccination center has one coordinator"

"Each vaccination center has a Center Coordinator that has the responsibility to manage the Covid19 vaccination process."


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*No acceptance criteria has been defined*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*User Stories dependencies: US010 and US012*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

*Identity here the data to be inputted by the system actor as well as the output data that the system have/needs to present in order to properly support the actor actions. Regarding the inputted data, it is suggested to distinguish between typed data and selected data (e.g. from a list)*

**Input Data**

• Typed data: *name, adress, phone number, email, fax number, website adress, opening hours, closing hours, slot duration, maximum number of vaccines per slot*

• Selected data: *vaccineCenterType, centerCoordinator, vaccineType*

**Output Data**

• *(In)Success of the operation*


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.* 


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * VaccinationCenter (HealthCareCenter or MassVaccinationCenter)


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RegisterVaccinationCenterUI  
 * RegisterVaccinationCenterController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US009-SD](US009-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US009-CD](US009-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*
